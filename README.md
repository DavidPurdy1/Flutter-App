# Flutter-App --- MedTrack
Make a medicine app that reminds you to take whatever medicines at a time the user sets using the clocks app by getting the device time and then either giving a notification or an alarm. Then you can use siri or google assistant to tell them that you took your medicine. When siri or google assistant notify the app that you took their medicine it will take the system time and date timestamping when they took it.
This way it is very easy to keep the app up to date and you won't forget to put in when you took them.
